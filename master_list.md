- Q1) What is a Binary Tree data structure? 
- It is a tree like data structure. <br/>

- Q2) Example of a binary tree data structure <br/>
<img src="/assets/binary_tree.png" alt="Binary Tree Example" width="15%"/> 

- A is the root 
- Each entry is a node 
- Every node is connected by links called edges which defines the relationships between 
- Every node has a parent above it except the root 
- Each node has a left or right child or none or both 
- Every node can have a maximum of 2 nodes hence it is called a binary tree 
- A node with no children is called a leaf 
- A node contains a value or data 
- There are two subtrees in the example above (b,d,e and c,f,g) 
- The height of a tree is the length of the longest path to the leaf 
- In the example above, the height of a tree is 4 
- The size of a tree is the number of nodes 
- In the example above, the size of a treee is 8
- The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root that particular node 
- In the example above, the depth of node 8 is 4 
- The height of a node is measured from the node to the deepest leaf 
- In the example above, the height of node 2 is 3 

-Q3) Definition of tree traversal ?
- Tree traversal is a process where it visits all the nodes in the tree 

-Q4) How do we traverse a tree ? 
- Method 1: 
- Method 2: 
- Method 3:
